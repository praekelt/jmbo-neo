Changelog
=========

0.4 (23-05-2013)
----------------
#. Use random password for Neo auth instead of actual user password.
#. Only `Member.full_clean` throws ValidationError, not `Member.save` anymore.
#. Remove auth backend and middleware. The user's plain text password isn't stashed in the session or on the `member` object anymore.
#. Add `created` field to `NeoProfile` - useful for checking consumer creation limit (10 000 per day at the moment).
#. Reduce test time by re-using an immutable member where possible.

0.3 (03-05-2013)
----------------
#. Add a new management command to export members for bulk upload:
   ``members_to_cidb_dataloadtool``
#. Automatically create consumers on CIDB for members on login.
#. Consumer creation deferred until a member is complete according to `RegistrationPreferences.required_fields`.
#. Consumer fields are kept in sync with member fields over MCAL.
#. Use `login_alias` instead of `Member.username` for CIDB communications. 

0.2 (09-11-2012)
----------------
#. Create member if credentials are valid and the member does not exist.
#. Fix bug in logout.

0.1 (18-10-2012)
----------------
#. Initial release
